## Overview

**Sleep-Well Mobile App** is the **sequel** to our previous
project, [Sleep-Well RESTful API Web Service](https://github.com/Nantawat6510545543/sleep-well).  
The original project focused on collecting and analyzing sleep data through an API service.

> **Original Project Overview**:  
> Sleep-Well is a RESTful API web service designed to offer sleep quality data to users. The API
> provides endpoints for accessing sleep information, including sleep duration, quality scores,
> environmental factors (such as weather and noise levels), and personal information about an
> individual's sleep patterns. It also features analytics to analyze sleep comments and provide
> insights into sleep quality trends.

## Project Overview

**Sleep-Well Mobile App** extends this concept by turning the backend insights into a user-friendly
**mobile experience**. It uses a trained AI model to predict sleep scores based on personal and
environmental data, and helps users track and improve their sleep habits.

Key features include:

- AI-powered sleep score prediction
- Environmental data integration via WeatherAPI
- Background noise detection using the phone microphone
- Visualization of sleep trends and insights

## AI Model

The AI model was developed using Google Colab and trained to predict a sleep quality score based on
both personal and environmental factors.
